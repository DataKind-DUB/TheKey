### Data Security

# No personally identifying data to be stored in this repo. None.

Selected, anonymised datasets will be made available by Ambassadors and Leaders and you may obtain these files and store them here on your own machine only.

For convenience, the .gitignore file is configured to ignore common flat files, database files and documents, but this is far from foolproof, so _please make sure to NOT commit any data to this repo_. 

Regular checks will be made throughout the project to make sure no data is in the master repo by accident.
