## Overview

[The Key](http://www.yourpotentialunlocked.org.uk/) provide a programme for young people aged between 11 and 25 to choose a project to develop from the initial idea through to implementation and completion. They design a project, plan to make it happen, and then pitch the idea to a panel of adults. After this supportive "Dragon's Den" experience they receive a small budget to spend on their project.
